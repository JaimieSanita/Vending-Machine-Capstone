<h2 id="module1capstone-vendingmachinesoftware">Module 1 Capstone - Vending Machine Software</h2>

<p>You&#8217;ve been asked to develop an application for the newest vending machine distributor,
Umbrella Corp. They&#8217;ve released a new vending machine, Vendo-Matic 800, that is integrated
with everyone&#8217;s bank accounts, allowing customers to purchase products from their computers for their convenience.</p>

<h3 id="applicationrequirements">Application Requirements</h3>

<ol>
<li>The vending machine dispenses beverages, candy, chips, and gum.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li> Each vending machine item has a Name and a Price.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>A main menu must display when the software runs, presenting the following options:

<blockquote>
<pre><code>(1) Display Vending Machine Items
(2) Purchase
(3) Exit
</code></pre>
</blockquote></li>
<li>The vending machine inventory is stocked via an input file when the vending machine
starts.</li>
<li>The vending machine is automatically restocked each time the application runs.</li>
<li>When the customer selects &#8220;(1) Display Vending Machine Items&#8221;, they&#8217;re presented
with a list of all items in the vending machine with its quantity remaining:

<ul>
<li>Each vending machine product has a slot identifier and a purchase price.</li>
<li>Each slot in the vending machine has enough room for 5 of that product.</li>
<li>Every product is initially stocked to the maximum amount.</li>
<li>A product that has run out must indicate that it is SOLD OUT.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When the customer selects &#8220;(2) Purchase&#8221;, they are guided through the purchasing
process menu:

<blockquote>
<pre><code>(1) Feed Money
(2) Select Product
(3) Finish Transaction

Current Money Provided: $2.00
</code></pre>
</blockquote></li>
<li>The purchase process flow is as follows:

<ol>
<li>Selecting &#8220;(1) Feed Money&#8221; allows the customer to repeatedly feed money into the
machine in valid, whole dollar amounts (e.g. $1, $2, $5, or $10).

<ul>
<li>The &#8220;Current Money Provided&#8221; indicates how much money the customer
has fed into the machine.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Selecting &#8220;(2) Select Product&#8221; allows the customer to select a product to
purchase.

<ul>
<li>Show the list of products available and allow the customer to enter
a code to select an item.</li>
<li>If the product code does not exist, the customer is informed and returned
to the Purchase menu.</li>
<li>If a product is sold out, the customer is informed and returned to the
Purchase menu.</li>
<li>If a valid product is selected, it is dispensed to the customer.</li>
<li>Dispensing an item prints the item name, cost, and the money
remaining. Dispensing also returns a message:</li>
<li> All chip items print &#8220;Crunch Crunch, Yum!&#8221;</li>
<li> All candy items print &#8220;Munch Munch, Yum!&#8221;</li>
<li> All drink items print &#8220;Glug Glug, Yum!&#8221;</li>
<li> All gum items print &#8220;Chew Chew, Yum!&#8221;</li>
<li>After the product is dispensed, the machine must update its balance
accordingly and return the customer to the Purchase menu.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Selecting &#8220;(3) Finish Transaction&#8221; allows the customer to complete the
transaction and receive any remaining change.

<ul>
<li>The customer&#8217;s money is returned using nickels, dimes, and quarters
(using the smallest amount of coins possible).</li>
<li>The machine&#8217;s current balance must be updated to $0 remaining.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>After completing their purchase, the user is returned to the &#8220;Main&#8221; menu to
continue using the vending machine.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>All purchases must be audited to prevent theft from the vending machine:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li> Each purchase must generate a line in a file called <code>Log.txt</code>.</li>
<li> The audit entry must be in the format:
&gt;<code>&gt; 01/01/2016 12:00:00 PM FEED MONEY: $5.00 $5.00
 &gt;01/01/2016 12:00:15 PM FEED MONEY: $5.00 $10.00
 &gt;01/01/2016 12:00:20 PM Crunchie B4 $10.00 $8.50
 &gt;01/01/2016 12:01:25 PM Cowtales B2 $8.50 $7.50
 &gt;01/01/2016 12:01:35 PM GIVE CHANGE: $7.50 $0.00
 &gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Create as many of your classes as possible to be &#8220;testable&#8221; classes. Limit console
input and output to as few classes as possible.</li>
<li>Optional - Sales Report

<ul>
<li>Provide a &#8220;Hidden&#8221; menu option on the main menu (&#8220;4&#8221;) that writes to a sales
report that shows the total sales since the machine was started. The name of the
file must include the date and time so each sales report is uniquely named.</li>
<li>An example of the output format is provided below.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Provide unit tests demonstrating that your code works correctly.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="vendingmachinedatafile">Vending Machine Data File</h3>

<p>The input file that stocks the vending machine products is a pipe <code>|</code> delimited file. Each line is a separate product in the file and follows the below format:</p>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col />
<col />
</colgroup>

<thead>
<tr>
	<th> Column Name </th>
	<th> Description </th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td> Slot Location </td>
	<td> The slot location in the vending machine where the product is set. </td>
